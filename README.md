Hi,

My name os Allan Spadini
I will put in here some usefull functions that were usefull in my masters and Phd.
Under the supervision of Professors:
Liliana Alcazar Diogo
and
Renato Luiz Prado

Some of the functions were inspired by SeismicLab since I wanted a version of then in python:

I'm implementing this codes while learning python so don't expect clean or usefull code. I do not guarantee your computer will not blow up either.



Requirements:
I use Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Obspy
